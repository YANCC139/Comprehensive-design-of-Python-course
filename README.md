# Comprehensive-design-of-Python-course
This is a big assignment for the python course. I put it here
This project is a simple crawler, data analysis and visualization operation, using some basic Python libraries, including pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, etc
Crawled website is https://lishi.tianqi.com/ , two cities Changsha and Chengdu are selected for simple comparison, and the files can also be modified.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Code part:
(1)main.py:It is mainly used for crawling and simple data processing
(2)average_data_show.py:Visual analysis of monthly average temperature in Changsha and Chengdu in 2019
(3)average_t.py:Visual analysis of 365 day average temperature in Changsha and Chengdu in 2019
(4)weather_condition.py:Analysis of weather conditions in Changsha and Chengdu in 2019 (for convenience, as long as it rains on that day, whether it turns sunny or cloudy to rainy, I will regard it as a rainy day)
